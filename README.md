#WooCommerce Plugin: Sync Order Status

Adds "Sync" as an order status (it's added directly after "Processing").

Requires PHP 7.1 or higher, which reached End-of-Life over a year ago, so if you're using an older version, you have bigger issues to deal with.

Special thanks to the blogs I read to build this plugin:
* [How to create a WooCommerce custom order status - Jilt](https://jilt.com/blog/woocommerce-custom-order-status-2/)
* [How to Safely Add Custom Code to WordPress Sites - SkyVerge](https://www.skyverge.com/blog/add-custom-code-to-wordpress/)
